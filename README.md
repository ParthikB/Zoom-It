# zoom in please!

*I really don't remember how this idea came to me and I didn't wasted much time, I wanted to get this done quickly 'cause I wanted to see the results! This is just so cool.*

So what's happening here? 

Here, I'm re-building an Image using many other smaller Images which are similar in color to the Pixel Block it's replaced with. 
Umm ...I don't think I did a great job explaining this, but well, why don't you **zoom-in-please**!
